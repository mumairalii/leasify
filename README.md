**Live Demo**: ## About The Project

Leasify is a comprehensive platform built to modernize and simplify property management. It provides a dedicated portal for landlords to manage their properties, leases, and finances, while offering tenants a convenient way to handle payments, submit maintenance requests, and view their lease details.

The goal is to reduce administrative friction and improve communication, creating a more harmonious rental ecosystem. This application is built from the ground up using a modern MERN-like stack.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.x or later)
* npm
* MongoDB (You can use a local instance or a free cloud instance from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/leasify.git](https://github.com/your-username/leasify.git)
    cd leasify
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Install NPM packages
    npm install

    # Create a .env file from the example
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open `backend/.env` and add your configuration values (MongoDB URI, JWT Secret, Stripe Keys).

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
    cd frontend

    # Install NPM packages
    npm install

    # Create a development environment file
    # (You can just create a file named .env.development)
    ```
    In `frontend/.env.development`, add the following line:
    `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api`

### Running the Application

1.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    *From the `backend` directory:*
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    Your backend API will be running at `http://localhost:5001`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**
    *From the `frontend` directory (in a new terminal):*
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port specified in your terminal) to view the app in your browser.

## Project Status
This project is currently in **Version 1.0**. Future improvements planned for V2 include:
-   API-level pagination for all data tables.
-   A comprehensive automated testing suite (Jest, Supertest, React Testing Library).
-   Real-time notifications for maintenance and application status updates.
-   Refactoring backend queries to use MongoDB's aggregation pipeline for better performance.
